# webCrawler

Hi, this is a web crawler that I implemented using the "Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures" book by Daniel Liang. You input a URL, the program scans the HTML page of the target URL, gathers further URLs on that HTML page (if any), and repeats the process for those URLs. 

I've the set the max number of traversed URLs to 100.
